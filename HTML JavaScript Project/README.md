Why are we doing this?

We are creating this project in order to demonstrate our knowledge gained in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that we 
acquired through the QA Academy.

How I expected the challenge to go

I expected the project to have it's challenges, but I was confident that the skills that I was tought would be 
enough for me to complete it. Anything I didn't know, but needed to know to complete the project, I expected to be 
able to find out through the QA Community website or the internet.

What went well?

I created a fully functioning application that completely met the brief of the project given to me. I combined the 
use of a JavaScript document for JSON data storage, a JavaScript document for all of my script and a HTML document 
for the design of the application, which pulled elements from the JavaScript documents.

What didn't go as planned?

There was some difficulty in making it easy for the user to select records, but I managed to use the knowledge 
tought to me in order to get around this obstacle and find a way to meet the brief.

Possible improvements for the future

If I had more time, I would have liked to have tidied up my code in terms of reducing duplication, utilised more 
CSS in order to make my application look more attractive to the user and to make the application more user 
friendly.
