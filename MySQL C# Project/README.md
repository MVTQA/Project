Why are we doing this?

We are creating this project in order to demonstrate our knowledge gained in MySQL and C# that we acquired through 
the QA Academy.

How I expected the challenge to go

I expected the project to go really well as I was confident in my abilities using MySQL and C# that were tought to 
me in the QA Academy. Anything I didn't know, but needed to know to complete the project, I expected to be able to 
find out through the QA Community website or through the internet.

What went well?

I created a C# application that completely met the brief of the project that was given to me. The C# application 
is fully functional and links seamlessly with the MySQL database that I created to deliver a great user 
experience, with minimal code duplication.

What didn't go as planned?

Getting some of the queries to work was a very small difficulty, but it only took one alteration with each of them 
to fix.

Possible improvements for the future

If I had more time, I would have liked to have created options in the menus to exit out of the application.
